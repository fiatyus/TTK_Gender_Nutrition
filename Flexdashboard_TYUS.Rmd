# About

<h2>**Understanding Food Security Drivers:**</h2>

<h3>Household Gender Structure and Nutrition Knowledge in Malawi (Titukulane) and Zimbabwe (Takunda)</h3>

| Topic | Details |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Core Themes** | Care groups, nutritional cash transfer, dietary diversity, and food security |
| **Geography** | Malawi (Titukulane) and Zimbabwe (Takunda) |
| **Programs** | The Takunda and Titukulane programs are CARE intiatives funded by USAID. Both programs seek to reduce food insecurity through the participation in nutrition focused interventions. |
| **Research question** | During FY 24, in both the Takunda and Titukulane programs, is there a relationship between the gendered structure of the household and child feeding and nutrition practice knowledge? What factors confound that relationship? |
| **Background** | Food security remains one of the most pressing issues of our time. This project seeks to analyze the ways program interventions, internal behaviors, and demographics may impact measures of food security. |
| **Project Status** | This project was completed as a part of both the epidemiology and the data science certificate capstone courses (EPI 598C and DATA 555 respectively). Launching of this interactive dashboard and github repository satisfied the requirements for the completion of the Rollins School of Public Health Data Science certificate. <br>Updates will not continue after final submission on April 25th. |
| **Impact and Importance** | This analysis is incredible timely, as organizations like CARE seek to improve food security outcomes while also understanding the social factors and structures that contribute to effective interventions. This dashboard explores how household gender structure may impact intervention success, and translates this information into digestible visualizations. |

### Variables Explained

<h2>Understanding the Variables</h2>

<h3><strong>üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Gendered Structure of the Household (GSoH)</strong></h3>

-   **1** = Adult Male, no Adult Female (**MnF**)\
-   **2** = Adult Female, no Adult Male (**FnM**)\
-   **3** = Adult Male and Adult Female (**M&F**)\
-   **4** = Female Child, no Adults (**CNAF**)\
-   **5** = Male Child, no Adults (**CNAM**)

<em>Note: Categories 3, 4, and 5 were removed from analyses due to small sample size.</em>

<h3><strong> üéÇ Age </strong></h3>

A continuous variable representing participant age (in years).

<h3><strong>‚ö• Sex </strong></h3>

Biological sex as reported by participants: **male** or **female**.

<h3><strong>üìä Intervention Participation</strong></h3>

Total number of interventions each participant was involved in.

<h3><strong>üçΩÔ∏è Feeding Practices Known</strong></h3>

Participants were asked about child feeding practices they were aware of during the PaBS survey.\
This measure reflects **knowledge**, not actual behavior.

Scores ranged from **0 to 7 known practices**.

- ‚ùå **0 practices known**\
- ‚úîÔ∏è **1 or more practices known**

### Dataset description

<h2>Dataset source and information</h2>

This project combines the **FY24 data** and results of the **‚ÄòParticipant Annual Based Survey‚Äô (PaBS)** of the two programs: ‚ÄòTakunda‚Äô of Zimbabwe and ‚ÄòTitukulane‚Äô of Malawi.

Both programs involve the participation in up to eighteen (18) intervention programs aimed at improving food security outcomes. Survey participants are a subset of the participants in both programs, 1332 participants surveyed for ‚ÄòTakunda‚Äô and 1293 participants surveyed for ‚ÄòTitukulane‚Äô program.

Results were gathered through **in person interviews**.

While the **full** **datasets themselves are confidential**, the findings can be shared and presented as a part of the Rollins epidemiology capstone project.

**Key variables include:**

-   Gendered structure of the household

-   Knowledge of feeding practices

-   Age(years)

-   Sex(male/female)

-   Country/program

## Column {data-width="250"}

### Takunda Participants

```{r}
TKD_participants <- data_filtered %>% filter(program=="TAKUNDA") %>%  summarise(n())
valueBox(TKD_participants, icon = "fa-globe")
```

### Titukulane Participants

```{r}
TTK_participants <- data_filtered %>% filter(program=="TITUKULANE") %>%  summarise(n())
valueBox(TTK_participants, icon = "fa-globe")
```

### Adult Female no Adult Male Households

```{r}
TTK_participants <- data_filtered %>% filter(Gendered_HH_Type=="Adult Female no Adult Male (FnM)") %>%  summarise(n())
valueBox(TTK_participants, icon = "fa-female")
```

### Adult Male and Adult Female Households

```{r}
TTK_participants <- data_filtered %>% filter(Gendered_HH_Type=="Adult Male and Adult Female (M&F)") %>%  summarise(n())
valueBox(TTK_participants, icon = "fa-group")
```

### Participants know 1 or more feeding practices

```{r}
TTK_participants <- data_filtered %>% filter(KFP == "One or more (1+)") %>%  summarise(n())
valueBox(TTK_participants, icon = "fa-school")
```

# Interactive Visualizations {.storyboard}

```{r}
# Create a new variable to seperate jitter points from boxplot
data_filtered$HH_type_jitter <- as.numeric(factor(data_filtered$Gendered_HH_Type)) + 0.25  # Nudges jitter to the right
```

### **Boxplot** <br>Gendered Structure of the Household (GSoH) and Total Knowledge (count)

```{r}

boxplot_1B <- ggplot(data_filtered, aes(x= Gendered_HH_Type, y = KFP_sum, fill = program)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.4, position = position_nudge(x = -0.25)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = label_wrap(20)) +  
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Program")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#F67601','#5C2163'))+
  labs(x = "Gendered Household Type",
       y = "Total Feeding Practices Known (count)",
       title = "Gendered Household Type and Feeding Practices Known") +
  theme_minimal()

note_2 <- "Note: For more information on feeding practices visit the methodology page"

plotly_1B <- ggplotly(boxplot_1B, tooltip = "text") %>% 
    layout(margin = list(l = 50, r = 50, b = 100, t = 50),
         annotations = list(x = 0.8, y = -0.3, text = str_wrap(note_2, 50),
                            xref='paper', yref='paper', showarrow = F, 
                            xanchor='auto', yanchor='auto', xshift=100, yshift=-20,
                            font = list(size = 10)))

plotly_1B <- plotly_1B %>% layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", x = 0, y = -0.2))

plotly_1B %>% layout(boxmode = "group")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Takeaways:**

This graph provides a view of the distribution of feeding practices known, separated by gendered household type. When viewing this widget, we see that across both household types, participants can know between 0 and 7 practices. It does lead to the belief that those in the Titukulane (purple) program on average know fewer feeding practices, while those in Takunda (orange) know significantly more.

### **Barchart** (participant count) <br> Program and Knowledge (binary)

```{r}

# Create a new variable to seperate jitter points from boxplot
data_filtered$HH_type_jitter <- as.numeric(factor(data_filtered$Gendered_HH_Type)) + 0.25  # Nudges jitter to the right


# Calculate counts per program and KFP
data_with_count <- data_filtered %>%
  count(program, KFP) %>%
  mutate(text = paste("Program:", program, "<br>Feeding Practices Known:", KFP, "<br>Count:", n))

# Create the bar chart with the calculated counts
bar_chart <- ggplot(data = data_with_count, aes(fill = KFP, x = program, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", aes(text = text)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = label_wrap(20)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#5C2163', '#F67601'))+
  labs(x = "Program",
       y = "Participants (count)",
       title = "Program and Feeding Practices Known")

# Convert to plotly and specify the tooltip
ggplotly(bar_chart, tooltip = "text") %>% 
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", x = 0, y = -0.15))

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Takeaways:**

This barchart shows feeding practices known as a binary variable with participants either knowing 0 practices or 1 or more practices. Without the noise of gendered household type, this graph clearly shows that Takunda participants are more likely to know 1 or more feeding practices.

### **Barchart** (proportion)<br>GSoH, Program, and Knowledge (binary)

```{r}
data_with_count <- data_filtered %>%
  count(Gendered_HH_Type, KFP) %>%
  mutate(text = paste("GSoH:", Gendered_HH_Type, "<br>Feeding Practices Known:", KFP, "<br>Count:", n))

data_with_count_facet <- data_filtered %>%
  count(Gendered_HH_Type, KFP, program) %>% 
  mutate(text = paste("GSoH:", Gendered_HH_Type, "<br>Feeding Practices Known:", KFP, "<br>Count:", n, "<br>Program:", program))

data_with_count_facet <- data_with_count_facet %>% mutate(GSoH = 
  case_when(Gendered_HH_Type == "Adult Female no Adult Male (FnM)" ~ "FnM",
            Gendered_HH_Type == "Adult Male and Adult Female (M&F)" ~ "M&F")
)

KFP_v_GSoH_facet <- ggplot(data = data_with_count_facet, aes(x= GSoH, y=n, fill = KFP)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill", aes(text = text))+
  facet_wrap(~program)+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 20))+
  labs(x = "Gendered Structure of the Household",
       y = "Proportion of Participants",
       title = "Knowledge by Gendered Structure of the Household and Program",
       fill = "Feeding Practice's Known")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#5C2163', '#F67601'))+
  theme(legend.position="bottom",
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#BF7BB5", color = NA),
        strip.text = element_text(color = "white", face = "bold"))


ggplotly(KFP_v_GSoH_facet, tooltip = "text") %>% 
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", x = 0, y = -0.15))

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Takeaways:**

This plot compares knowledge by gendered structure of the household and program. This graph shows that program has a stronger impact on knowledge than gendered structure of the household. Knowledge rates remain comparable by gendered structure of the household.

### **Scatterplot** <br> Relationship between Interventions and Knowledge

```{r}

interventions_v_KFP <- data_filtered %>% group_by(interventions, KFP_sum) %>%
  mutate(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = interventions, y = KFP_sum, color = program, size = count)) +
  geom_point(aes(text = paste("Program: ", program, "<br>Feeding Practices Known: ", KFP_sum, "<br>Interventions participated in: ", interventions, "<br>Participants: ", count))) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Interventions Participated In",
       y = "Feeding Practices Known",
       title = "Intervention Participation and Feeding Practice Knowledge")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c('#5C2163', '#F67601'))

ggplotly(interventions_v_KFP, tooltip = "text") %>% 
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", x = 0, y = -0.2))

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Takeaways:**

This graph shows that interventions participated in has a slightly positive relationship with feeding practices known. Titukulane participants have a wider range of total interventions participated in (1 to 18), while Takunda participants participated in 1 to 10 interventions.
